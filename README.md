I'm a first-year Computer Science student at UBC, excited to explore the endless possibilities in tech and design. I’m all about learning, experimenting, and growing through every opportunity I find!  

✨ **What I’m up to:**  
- 📚 Studying Computer Science at UBC  
- ⚡️ Events Executive for **UBC Bolt**: A club combining business and data analytics, where I help organize case competitions and hackathons.  
- 🤖 Delving into **Machine Learning** and understanding how it powers innovation.
